5. **Encourage Peer Accountability**:
   - Team members should hold each other accountable instead of relying solely on the Scrum Master or Product Owner.
6. **Transparent Progress Tracking**:
   - Use Burndown/Burnup charts, Kanban boards, or dashboards to visualize progress.
7. **Support a Blameless Culture**:
   - Focus on learning from mistakes instead of punishing failures.
